# CVE Preserve

Few days ago, (*Feb 22, 2025*) [Mehmet][01] [asked][02] for contribution to his
project. I implemented a proof-of-concept version, and it seems to be working.

Parent project can be found:

https://github.com/mdisec/cve-url-crawling-dataset

## Installation

If you have go installation (*1.24*) on your machine:

```bash
go install github.com/vigo/cvepreserve@latest
```

then run `cvepreserve -h` for help or build from source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vigo/cvepreserve.git
cd cvepreserve/
go build .
```

then run `./cvepreserve -h` for help.

## Usage

Download dataset file to you local, `~100MB` json file.

```bash
curl -L -o dataset.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdisec/cve-url-crawling-dataset/main/dataset.json
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./cvepreserve          # if you are building from source, auto reads from dataset.json

# or
cvepreserve -dataset "/path/to/dataset.json"
```

The result database will be saved in the directory where you run the executable.
Sqlite database name is `result.sqlite3`
